# Predicting_Insincere_Questions_on_Quora
In this project we developed a model that identifies and flags insincere questions. While Quora has already employed both machine learning and manual review to address this problem through this project we plan to develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content, as Quora tries to implement its policy of "Be Nice, Be Respectful" to be a place for sharing and growing the world's knowledge.

## Tools Used:
* Bidirectional LSTM
* Topic Modelling
* Word frequency analysis
